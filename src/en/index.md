# Welcome to our apartment in Lindau!

We're delighted you've chosen our apartment for your stay in Lindau. We hope you'll feel as comfortable here as we do and wish you a wonderful time at Lake Constance!

## Quick Information

- **Keys:** You have two keys - both have square ends. The apartment key is branded with ABUS.
- **Location:** Our apartment is on the second floor, right side. Please note there's no elevator.
- **Wi-Fi:** Network name: **Martin**. Access data is on the telephone shelf in the hallway.

## During the stay

We prepared some snacks and drinks for you in the fridge. There are oat and toppings in the kitchen as well for preparing an oatmeal, porridge, or muesli breakfast. The coffee machine is ready for use. Would be great if you maintain the coffee machine by cleaning the brew group, milk frother, and milk container after each use.

## Important Notes

- Additional toilet paper is in the bathroom cabinet if needed.
- Umbrellas are available in the hallway wardrobe for your use.
- Additional towels are in the cabinet, in the room between the kitchen and the main bedroom.
- Check our [house rules](/en/house-rules/) for guidelines on maintaining the apartment.

## Garbage and Recycling

You'll find bins for organic waste, residual waste, plastics, and paper in the kitchen. Larger garbage bags can be disposed of in the garbage room in the courtyard. You can open the garbage room with the house main door key.

## Drinking Water and Tap Water

**Tap water:** in Germany, including Lindau, is safe to drink. In fact, Lindau's water comes directly from Lake Constance and undergoes careful treatment without chemicals. Thus you don't have to buy bottled water.

**Drinking Water Fountains:** Throughout the region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein), you'll find numerous drinking water fountains. The water is safe to drink unless you see a sign that says "Kein Trinkwasser" (No drinking water).

## Grocery Shopping and Dining

- **Shopping:** We recommend Netto at Marktplatz 5 or Rewe at Zeppelinstra√üe 6 (open 7 AM to 8 PM, closed on Sundays and holidays).
- **Restaurants:** Check out our [restaurant recommendations](/en/restaurants/) for dining options.
- **Transportation:** The Lindau-Insel train station is a 5-minute walk away. Visit our [transportation guide](/en/transportation/) for more details.
