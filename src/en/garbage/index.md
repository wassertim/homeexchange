# Waste & Recycling

You can throw trash bags into the large bin in the courtyard. The trash bins are located in a locked room next to the basement. You can open this room with the front door key. There are bins for organic waste, residual waste, and paper. You can exceptionally throw plastic waste into the residual waste.

## 🟢 Organic Waste

Organic waste includes kitchen waste that can decompose. This includes fruit and vegetable scraps, food leftovers, dairy products (yogurt, quark), coffee filters, tea bags, eggshells, bread scraps, flowers, plant waste and small cut garden waste like leaves or grass, hair, bone residues, crumpled paper.

## ⚫ Residual Waste

Residual waste refers to waste that cannot be recycled, i.e., anything that does not belong in the other bins for paper, plastic, or organic. Use it for dirty plastic, such as yogurt cups or butter packaging, as well.

## 🔵 Paper

The paper bin is for paper waste such as newspapers, magazines, books without hardcovers, writing paper, envelopes. Please dispose of larger cardboard boxes and packaging directly at the recycling center (see map below), instead of leaving them in the blue bin in the courtyard.

## 🟡 Yellow Bin

The Yellow Bin collects packaging made of plastic, metal, or composite materials such as beverage cartons. This includes plastic bottles, cups, foils, cans, aluminum foils, and canned food. It's important that these items are empty and as clean as possible.

## 🍾 Bottles

Bottles can be disposed of at the recycling center (see map below). If you have only a few bottles, you can simply leave them in the apartment.
