# Troubleshooting and Common Issues

If you encounter any problems during your stay, this guide may help you resolve common issues. If you can't find a solution here, please don't hesitate to contact us for assistance.

## Microwave Safety Switch Issue

If the microwave stops working, it may have triggered the safety switch. To resolve this:

In the entryway, on the wall opposite the front door, you'll find a small door in the wall above the telephone. This is the safety switch box. Open it and look for a switch in the down position. Flip this switch back up. You should now be able to use the microwave again.
