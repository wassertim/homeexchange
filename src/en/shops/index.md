## Shopping and Dining

The nearest supermarket is [Coop Baelliz](https://www.coop.ch/de/unternehmen/standorte-und-oeffnungszeiten/detail.html/5378/coop-supermarkt-thun-baelliz.html) â€“ just 3 minutes walk away. It's small but has the essentials. If you want more selection, you can walk to [Migros](https://filialen.migros.ch/de/migros-supermarkt-thun-baelliz) or [Coop City](https://www.coop.ch/de/unternehmen/standorte-und-oeffnungszeiten/detail.html/2193/coop-city-city-thun-kyburg.html) a bit further (also about 6 minutes on foot). At the train station there is a [Coop](https://filialen.migros.ch/de/migros-supermarkt-thun-baelliz), open until 10 PM and also on Sundays.
