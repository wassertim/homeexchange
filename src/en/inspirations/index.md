# What to Do in Thun

## Culture & Events

If you're interested in culture and concerts, there are numerous events in Thun. Particularly recommended is the [Thuner Seespiele](https://www.thunerseespiele.ch/), a musical theater festival that takes place every summer at Lake Thun. Many concerts and events also take place at [KKThun](https://www.kkthun.ch/de/) and in the [Stadtkirche Thun](https://www.refkirche-thun-stadt.ch/). You can also find information about events on [thunersee.ch](https://www.thunersee.ch/) and [thun.ch](https://www.thun.ch/tourismus/53989).

## Museums & Galleries

- The [Thun Panorama](https://www.thunpanorama.ch/) shows a unique 360-degree image of the city.
- [Thun Castle](https://www.schlossthun.ch/) is worth a visit.
- Art lovers should visit the [Kunstmuseum Thun](https://kunstmuseumthun.ch/).

## Nature & Parks

- Our favorite walk: Along the Aare (Aarenquai) starts right in front of our door – just walk towards Lake Thun and enjoy the water, birds and mountain panorama.
- The [Schadaupark](https://www.schloss-schadau.ch/en/park-and-surroundings/english-garden) offers an impressive view of the mountains and Lake Thun. For children there is a small train – timetables [here](https://www.dampfbahn-schadaupark.ch/fahrplan/). The park also houses [Schadau Castle](https://www.schloss-schadau.ch/).

## Walks / Hikes

### Aarenquai

Right from our house, you can take a beautiful walk along the water all the way to Hünibach. Take an Aare sack and you can swim back with the current ;)

### Burgundy Trail

A beautiful walk. Take bus B1 to Gwatt, Deltapark. Get off at Gwatt, Moos and off you go. A very short but very beautiful walk.
