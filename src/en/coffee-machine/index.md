# Coffee Machine - User Guide

Our Sage The Oracle coffee machine allows you to enjoy barista-quality coffee right in our kitchen. Here is a quick guide on how to prepare espresso and froth milk.

## Starting the Coffee Machine:

- Turn on the machine using the power switch on the front.
- Wait until the machine heats up to 93 degrees. The current status and temperature are displayed on the screen.

## Preparing Espresso:

- In the cabinet above the coffee machine, you will find coffee beans - both regular and decaffeinated coffee.
- Fill the coffee container with the selected coffee. You can use an espresso cup as a measuring cup to measure the right amount.
- For a single shot espresso, you should use the special single-shot filter basket located in the removable drip tray. For a double espresso (Double Shot) or two cups, use the regular filter basket.
- Insert the portafilter into the brew group.
- Select the desired cup size. The corresponding coffee cups can also be found in the cabinet above the coffee machine.
- The grind size has been set for decaffeinated coffee. If the extraction runs too fast, adjust to a finer grind size using the left control (lower number). If it runs too slow, adjust to a coarser grind size (higher number).
- For a single shot espresso, press the 1-cup button (30 seconds extraction). For a double espresso or two cups, use the 2-cup button (40 seconds extraction).

## Frothing Milk:

- Fill the milk pitcher up to the mark with milk. For using oat milk, you can use Oatly Barista Oat Milk from the pantry in the hallway.
- Position the milk pitcher under the milk frother and select the desired froth level.
- Start the milk frother (turn the right control down for automatic operation; up for manual operation) and wait until the milk reaches the perfect consistency and the temperature does not exceed 65 degrees Celsius.
- After each frothing, clean the frothing nozzle with a wet cloth.

Now you can combine your espresso with the frothed milk to create the perfect cappuccino or latte macchiato. Enjoy your coffee!
