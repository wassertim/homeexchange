# Coffee Machine – User Manual

With our Sage The Oracle coffee machine, you can enjoy barista-quality coffee right in our kitchen. Here's a short guide for espresso and frothed milk.

## Turning on the Machine

- Turn on the machine with the power switch on the front.

- Wait until the machine heats up to 93 degrees. Current status and temperature are shown on the display.

## Preparing Espresso

- In the cabinet above the coffee machine you'll find coffee beans – both regular and decaffeinated.

- Fill the beans into the container. You can use an espresso cup for measuring.

- For a single espresso, use the special single-shot filter insert (located in the removable drip tray). For a double espresso (double shot) or two cups, use the normal filter insert.

- Insert the portafilter into the brew group.

- Select the desired cup size. The appropriate cups are also in the cabinet above the coffee machine.

- For decaffeinated coffee, the grind size is already set. If the coffee runs through too fast, adjust finer (left control, smaller number). If it runs too slow, adjust coarser (larger number).

- For a single espresso, press the 1-cup button (30 seconds extraction). For a double espresso or two cups, use the 2-cup button (40 seconds extraction).

## Frothing Milk

- Fill milk up to the marking in the milk pitcher.

- Place the pitcher under the milk frother and select the foam level.

- Start the milk frother (right control down for automatic, up for manual) and wait until the milk reaches the perfect consistency and max. 65 degrees.

- Important note: After each frothing, clean the nozzle with a damp cloth.

Now you can combine the espresso with the frothed milk to make a cappuccino or latte macchiato. Enjoy!
