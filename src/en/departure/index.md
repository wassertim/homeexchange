# Departure Checklist

Thank you for choosing our apartment for your stay! We hope you've had a wonderful time. To help make your departure smooth, we've prepared this handy checklist. We'd be very grateful if you could take a moment to go through these items:

## Before You Leave

- [ ] Turn off all heaters.
- [ ] Close all windows.
- [ ] Remove the bed linen from the mattresses and leave it on top of each bed. You do not need to wash them.
- [ ] If you used the coffee machine, make sure you clean it (surface, brew group, milk frother, and milk container).
- [ ] Load the dishwasher with any used dishes. Start the dishwasher before leaving.
- [ ] Clean all surfaces in the kitchen and the bathroom. For example, the door of the dishwasher could become greasy when you use it during cooking.
- [ ] Return all items to their original places.
- [ ] Report any accidental damage that may have occurred during your stay.
- [ ] Return the keys to the key safe using the same code you used to retrieve them.

Please leave the apartment in the same condition you found it upon arrival. This helps us maintain the apartment and ensures a pleasant experience for all guests.

We hope you had a wonderful stay. Safe travels home!
