## Design Principles

### 1. Content-First Approach

The site prioritizes content accessibility and readability. All design decisions support the primary goal of providing clear, actionable information to apartment guests.

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

The site works without JavaScript and enhances functionality when available. This ensures accessibility and performance across all devices and network conditions.

### 3. Maintainability

The architecture supports easy content updates, design changes, and feature additions. Clear separation of concerns enables different team members to work on different aspects.

### 4. Performance Optimization

Static site generation ensures fast loading times. Asset optimization and efficient markup reduce bandwidth usage and improve user experience.

### 5. Accessibility

The site follows WCAG guidelines for web accessibility, ensuring usability for guests with different abilities and assistive technologies.

## User Experience Design

### Information Architecture

The site follows a logical information hierarchy:
1. **Welcome/Overview** - Essential arrival information
2. **Practical Guides** - How-to instructions for apartment features
3. **Local Information** - Restaurants, transportation, attractions
4. **Reference Information** - Troubleshooting, emergency contacts

### Navigation Design

- **Primary Navigation**: Main sections accessible from every page
- **Contextual Navigation**: Related information linked within content
- **Responsive Navigation**: Collapsible mobile menu for smaller screens

### Content Strategy

- **Scannable Content**: Uses headings, lists, and clear sections
- **Actionable Information**: Focuses on what guests need to do
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Typography and spacing guide attention
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Detailed information available when needed

## Security and Performance

### Security Measures

- **Static Site Generation**: No server-side vulnerabilities
- **External Link Handling**: Proper `rel` attributes for external links
- **Content Security**: All content is curated and version-controlled

### Performance Optimization

- **Minimal JavaScript**: Only essential interactive features
